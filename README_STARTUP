For matlab paths to work for the pipeline script based here:

1) Place startup.m here containing "addpath /path/to/matlab/funtions" as needed. 

2) Create alias to start pipeline in .cshrc:  it should cd to this dir, before calling perl main here.
This causes startup.m here to be read and used by matlab to add to its path.

e.g. in .cshrc 
alias seg_pipe        cd /pipe_home/script/seg_pipe1; ./seg_pipe_main.pl
