seg_pipe_dc2 - 10/11/02
This is based on the directory seg_pipe1, but gets a more descriptive name (dc==double contrast),
but this v2 attempts to handle voxel size like seg_pipe_sc1 (the single contrast pipeline). 
now seg_pipe_mc - multiple contrast 
mc3 - 11/01/21 - canonical label directory can be changed with option on command line
